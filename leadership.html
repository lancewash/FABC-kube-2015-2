                                D. Lewis Sr. This is where she
                                gained her biblical foundation and passion to serve the Lord.</p>

                            <p>
                                Rev. Bev graduated in 1986 from Morris College in Sumter, South Carolina with a Bachelor
                                of Science Degree in
                                Mathematics. Rev. Bev is also a 2007 graduate of Jameson School of Ministry with a
                                Certificate in Biblical
                                Studies and she is currently matriculating in the Master of Divinity Program at Palmer

                                Professionally, she is an employee with the Department of Treasury.</p>

                            <p>Rev. Bev is a member of the historic First African Baptist Church in Darby Township,
                                Pennsylvania where the
                                Reverend Dr. Richard A. Dent is the Pastor. In addition to her Ministerial Duties, Rev.
                                Bev also serves in the following
                                ministries: New Members Discipleship Training – Adult and Youth Instructor, the Word of

                            <p>
                                When she was lost, Rev. Bev sought the Lord, He heard her and delivered her from all of
                                her fears; at this
                                point, she rededicated her life back to Jesus Christ and has not looked back. As she
                                began to study and meditate on the
                                Word of God, she found herself experiencing the deeper things of God. After much prayer
                                and fasting, she began
                                to seek God for His will for her life and the result was her call to preach the Good
                                News of Jesus Christ; she was
                                licensed to preach on June 26, 2011 and ordained on November 4, 2012 by Rev. Dr. Richard
                                A. Dent.</p>

                            <p>
                                The Lord blessed Rev. Bev with one son, Chad Jonathan Hudson. For such a time as this,
                                she stands on God’s
                                promises and relies on, “Being confident of this, that He who began a good work in us
                                will carry it on to completion
                                until the day of Christ Jesus” – Philippians 1:6.</p>

                            <h2>Minister Kenneth J.D. Wilson</h2>

                            <p>Brother Kenneth J. D. Wilson was born a twin to the late Patricia Wilson and Kent Wilson
                                in Nuremberg, Germany on November 8, 1980.
                                Kenneth and his twin brother Kevin were raised by their grandparents, George (deceased)
                                and Mary Atkings who took them to church and introduced them to the music ministry at an
                                early age. Kenneth was baptized and spiritually cultivated at Second Pilgrim Baptist
                                Church where he served on the youth choir and usher board. He later became a member of
                                the New Way Missionary Baptist Church where he was an active youth leader, Junior
                                Deacon, Usher and Choir Director.
                                After graduating from Saint Joseph’s Preparatory School in 1999, Kenneth went on to earn
                                his Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from the University of Connecticut and
                                subsequently earned a Master’s in Criminal Justice with a concentration in Behavioral
                                Analysis in 2006. Currently, he is matriculating in the Master of Divinity Program at
                                Palmer Theological Seminary.
                                Professionally, Kenneth is the Assistant Director of the Eva Donaldson School of Music.
                                Driven by the need to mentor young men of all ages, Kenneth is the founder of “A
                                Different Breed of Men”, a non-profit organization.
                                After many years of wrestling with what he knew to be the voice of the Lord, Kenneth
                                accepted the call of ministry on his life in March 2007.
                                As a faithful member of First African Baptist Church, Kenneth continues to prune his
                                gift for ministry as he actively serves in the following ministries: Discipleship
                                training, Marriage Ministry, Men’s Ministry, Chosen 300 and Music Ministry.
                                On May 12, 2012, Kenneth was united in marriage to his long time love Nicole G. Bynum;
                                the Lord blessed them with three children: Tahjae, JaDen and Kai.
                                In his servitude to the Lord, one of Kenneth’s favorite scripture is, “Moreover whom he
                                did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: them
                                he also glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us who can be
                                against us?” - Romans 8:30-31
