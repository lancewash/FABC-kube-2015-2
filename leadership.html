                            <p>Reverend Beverly S. Hudson accepted Jesus Christ and was baptized August 1975 at Mount Hermon Missionary
                                Baptist Church in Bishopville, South Carolina under the leadership of the late Rev. Bert D. Lewis Sr. This is where she
                                gained her biblical foundation and passion to serve the Lord.</p>
                            <p>
                                Rev. Bev graduated in 1986 from Morris College in Sumter, South Carolina with a Bachelor of Science Degree in

                                Professionally, she is an employee with the Department of Treasury.</p>
                            <p>Rev. Bev is a member of the historic First African Baptist Church in Darby Township, Pennsylvania where the
                                Reverend Dr. Richard A. Dent is the Pastor. In addition to her Ministerial Duties, Rev. Bev also serves in the following

                            <p>
                                When she was lost, Rev. Bev sought the Lord, He heard her and delivered her from all of her fears; at this
                                point, she rededicated her life back to Jesus Christ and has not looked back. As she began to study and meditate on the
                                Word of God, she found herself experiencing the deeper things of God. After much prayer and fasting, she began
                                to seek God for His will for her life and the result was her call to preach the Good News of Jesus Christ; she was
                                licensed to preach on June 26, 2011 and ordained on November 4, 2012 by Rev. Dr. Richard A. Dent.</p>
                            <p>
                                The Lord blessed Rev. Bev with one son, Chad Jonathan Hudson. For such a time as this, she stands on God’s
                                promises and relies on, “Being confident of this, that He who began a good work in us will carry it on to completion
                                until the day of Christ Jesus” – Philippians 1:6.</p>
